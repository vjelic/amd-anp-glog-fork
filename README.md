## Overview
ANP is a plugin library designed to enhance the [RCCL](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rccl) collective communication library with extended network transport support. The Makefile here compiles this plugin against a locally built RCCL and a ROCm environment.

---

## System Requirements
1. **Operating System**: Linux-based distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS).
2. **ROCm**:
   - Installed ROCm (tested with ROCm 6.x or later).
   - Default ROCm path is `/opt/rocm`; use `ROCM_PATH` to override.
3. **Dependencies**:
   - A working build of [RCCL](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rccl).
   - `hipcc` from the ROCm toolchain.
   - System libraries for network communication (e.g., `libibverbs`).

## Cloning and Building RCCL
If you do not already have a built version of RCCL, follow the steps here:
https://github.com/ROCm/rccl

---

## Cloning This Plugin Project
In a separate directory of your choice:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/amd-anp.git
cd amd-anp
```

---

## Build Instructions
1. **Ensure RCCL is built**: The `rccl/build` directory must contain `librccl.so`, `hipify/`, `include/`, etc.
2. **Set `RCCL_HOME`**:
   - Provide the path to the RCCL source tree
     ```bash
      export RCCL_HOME=/home/user/rccl-src/
      ```

4. **Optional: Set `RCCL_BUILD`**:
   - If the RCCL artifacts are not in $RCCL_HOME/build/release, then point to the build artifacts using RCCL_BUILD env var For example:
     ```bash
     export RCCL_BUILD=/home/user/rccl/build
     ```
5. **Specify `MPI` Paths:**

   -  Please provide the include and library paths for your MPI installation.
      ```bash
      export MPI_INCLUDE=/path/to/mpi/include
      export MPI_LIB_PATH=/path/to/mpi/lib
      ```
      Please make sure to replace the paths with your MPI installation's paths.

6. **Optional: `ROCM_PATH`**:
   - If ROCm is in a custom directory (not `/opt/rocm`), specify:
     ```bash
     make RCCL_HOME=$RCCL_HOME ROCM_PATH=/path/to/rocm
     ```

7. **Build Without Telemetry (Default):**

    To build the plugin without the telemetry features enabled (the default behavior), simply run the `make` command:

    ```bash
    make RCCL_HOME=$RCCL_HOME MPI_INCLUDE=$MPI_INCLUDE MPI_LIB_PATH=$MPI_LIB_PATH
    ```
    If successful, you will see `librccl-net.so` in the `build/` folder of this plugin project.

    **Example:**
    ```bash
    make RCCL_HOME=/home/user/rccl-src/ MPI_INCLUDE=/home/user/ompi-4.1.6/install/include/ MPI_LIB_PATH=/home/user/ompi-4.1.6/build/ompi/.libs/
    ```
8.  **Build With Telemetry Enabled:**

    To build the plugin with telemetry features enabled use the build command with flag ANP_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=1.

    ```bash
    make ANP_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=1 RCCL_HOME=$RCCL_HOME MPI_INCLUDE=$MPI_INCLUDE MPI_LIB_PATH=$MPI_LIB_PATH
    ```
    If successful, you will see `librccl-net.so` in the `build/` folder of this plugin project.

    **Example:**
    ```bash
    make ANP_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=1 RCCL_HOME=/home/user/rccl-src/ MPI_INCLUDE=/home/user/ompi-4.1.6/install/include/ MPI_LIB_PATH=/home/user/ompi-4.1.6/build/ompi/.libs/

---

## Install Instructions
To install the plugin into your ROCm library path, run:
```bash
sudo make RCCL_HOME=$RCCL_HOME ROCM_PATH=/path/to/rocm install
```
This copies `librccl-net.so` to `<ROCM_PATH>/lib`.
`<ROCM_PATH>` defaults to `/opt/rocm` unless overridden by `ROCM_PATH`.

---

## Cleanup Instructions

### `clean` Target

The `clean` target is used to remove the build directory and its contents. This is useful for starting a fresh build or for cleaning up intermediate build artifacts.

**Usage:**
```bash
make clean
```

### `uninstall` Target

The uninstall target is used to remove the compiled plugin library `librccl-net.so` from the installation path `<ROCM_PATH>/lib`

**Usage:**
```bash
make uninstall
```

---

## Enabling Telemetry
AMD ANP plugin provides telemetry capabilities for monitoring device status and performance. The telemetry data is captured and stored in JSON format, giving insights into communication efficiency and queue pair operations. This feature is part of the supported telemetry suite and helps in performance analysis and debugging.

To enable telemetry, the plugin must be compiled with ANP_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=1.
It then reads its configuration from a JSON file, whose location is specified by an environment variable RCCL_ANP_CONFIG_FILE.
In the absence of the environment variable RCCL_ANP_CONFIG_FILE or the JSON file being unreadable, plugin uses defaults for the configuration.

```
export RCCL_ANP_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/config.json
```

### Configuration JSON
```json
{
  "log_level": "ERROR",
  "output_dir": "/tmp",
  "max_buckets": 5,
  "bucket_interval_ns": 30000
}
```
- `log_level`: Specifies the log level for telemetry logs.
- `output_dir`: Specifies the output directory for files generated by plugin.
- `max_buckets`: Maximum number of histogram buckets for latency tracking.
- `bucket_interval_ns`: Time interval (in nanoseconds) for latency bucket division.


## Device Status JSON

AMD ANP plugin generates a JSON file containing detailed device status and performance metrics. The JSON structure provides a hierarchical view of device status, including:
- **Device metadata** (host, process details, RoCE device, etc.).
- **Channel-level stats**, including queue pairs.
- **Queue pair stats**, covering WQE send/receive/completion data.
- **Latency histogram** for WQE completions.
- **Aggregated statistics**, including WQE size distribution and overall counts.

This generated data serves as part of the supported telemetry features. It can be used to monitor network performance, analyze latencies, and optimize communication between devices.

### Structure Overview
The JSON contains a list of `devices`, where each device has:
- **Status Information**: Metadata about the device and the running process.
- **Channels**: Each device contains multiple channels.
- **Queue Pairs (QP)**: Each channel has multiple queue pairs that handle communication.
- **Statistics**: Various performance metrics are recorded at different levels.

### Device-Level Information

Each device contains the following information under the `status` key:

| Key             | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `host_name`    | Host machine name running the process |
